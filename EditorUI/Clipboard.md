# Clipboard

You can copy, cut, and paste every block, BGO, NPC, or physical environment area in the level editor and any object on the world map.

If you want to paste anything, your cursor changes the look into a paste icon, and you enter paste-mode. In this mode, you can paste your copied items. Items will appear in the top-left corner of your cursor.

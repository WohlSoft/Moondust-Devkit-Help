**Palette filter** - A tool to adjust colours of images into the palette of a reference picture.

## How it works

This utility can be used to adjust the palette of any images you have into the given reference picture that
contains the set of colours of your palette.

This is an example of the reference image that defines the target palette:

![Ref](../../screenshots/Tools/console/PalleteFilter/reference_example.png ":no-zoom")

This is the source image before the filtering:

![Ref](../../screenshots/Tools/console/PalleteFilter/example_src.png ":no-zoom")

After you run the utility, you will get the next result:

![Ref](../../screenshots/Tools/console/PalleteFilter/example_dst.png ":no-zoom")

located. Alternatively, you can use this utility from your scripts and utilities and run this utility externally.

## Moondust Project
_A Platform Game Engine project by Wohlstand_

_This project is distributed under [GNU GNLv3](../license.html)._


**So what exactly is this?** It's a free/open-source game engine and
toolkit which gives the ability to create games of the platforming genre.

The basic idea of this project is to make it possible for every user
to create platformers with existing or self-drawn sprites. This idea was inspired by the SMBX fan game, but the main drawback of SMBX is a strict data
standard and it's attachment to Nintendo's "Super Mario" franchise.

The Engine will be compatible with SMBX. It's main components would be a
(SMBX compatible) game engine and a tool-kit for creating games.

I've been working on this project since at least December 2013.


### Name of project
The Project initially had the "PlatGenWohl" codename ("**P**latform **G**ame **e**ngine by **Wohl**stand"), later the Project was renamed into "PGE Project" codename (a short of "**P**latform **G**ame **E**ngine"). However, a time later the discussion about the final name for the project was started as the "PGE" name is too generic and has a lot of name-sake cases around the world. The discussion has taken a long time until another poll was started where the "Moondust" name was chosen by community votes closer to the 2018'th year. However, the major rebranding process wasn't started until 2021 year. The final "**Moondust**" name was been used at minor places until the 2020'th year where it got started to be used wider (including the official Discord server name).


## History

### Beginning
In December 2013 I had the desire to create a [SMBX](WhatIsSMBX.md)-compatible
game engine, and in doing so, give it a new life. The inspiration for this was [Hedgewars](http://hedgewars.org/), a clone of the game
"Worms" by the company Team17. I decided to create a new game engine,
with the source-code being open under the GPLv3 License.

One of the most important parts of this project in my opinion is the
NAME. Because of the NAME he gave SMBX, Redigit was confronted with legal
consequences by Nintendo, and was forced to take the game down. Therefore,
the engine I will publish won't be named after "Mario", or any other
Nintendo properties.
Despite this, it will be fully compatible with SMBX, meaning it
IS possible to use SMBX files with my engine.

For the project I decided to use [Qt](http://qt.io) and
[SDL libraries](http://libsdl.org) with C++. I want to make the engine
cross-platform: for Windows, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS. The project will
live if it is free, libre, open-source.

### The Birth of the Editor
My introduction wasn't met well by the SMBX community, as they first thought I 
was another scammer advertizing a fake SMBX 1.4. After completing
the initial research, I started the actual development of the Editor
on March 24th, 2014. The Editor project began as a part of my 
SMBX Research Works that started some months before. 
On April 28th, 2014, Kevsoft joined the PGE Project, and shortly 
afterwards, Editor version 0.0.7-Alpha was released. The first
fully-featured version with the ability to read/write files, a history
manager, and full support of NPC rendering was 0.0.8-Alpha, which
was released on July 13th, 2014. On October 20th of 2014, after
a long time of development, the first stable and fully-featured
build of the editor was released with the ability to read/write
level-, world- and interactive NPC editor files etc. This version
had a multi-configuration system which allowed the use of different
content packages without needing to overwrite existing content files.

### Founding the Engine
In October 2014, I started the first sketch for the Engine. It was a simple SDL2 
application with the use of Box2D physics and OpenGL rendering. After some time, I made it able to play levels with simple graphics. The playable
character was just a blue rectangle. Gradually, I implemented the support
for the rest of the graphics, sound, world maps, menus, screens, etc.
I made it so playable characters would be rendered correctly. Bye-bye, blue rectangle!
The initial Lua scripting system was added to start making NPCs to act as intended. 
Later, I had found that Box2D doesn't give me what I need.
Therefore, I desired to code my own physics from scratch.
The last version of Engine with Box2D physics was 0.0.11-pre-alpha. Since the 0.1-Alpha,
the brand-new own-coded physical engine was used. Then, the world map got more
functionality and introduced the working path-opener. Since that moment, 
the world map engine is completed and working.

### The emergence of SMBX2 and my procrastination
Since Super Mario Bros. X2 was created at the end of 2015, I joined the
team to support several of it's components on invitation by Horikawa Otane.
Everything was fine. However, the year later, I got a lot of tasks at the Editor
that took a lot of time. I had no desire to work so much at Editor as
I already announced that it's already fine as-is for the current usage.
I wanted to develop Engine as I see it's one most important part of the
PGE Project. The team wanted more and more features in the Editor. I was
worked on that a lot. The SMBX2 team didn't saw any perspectives for
PGE Engine, and instead, they were focused on the LunaLua development.
In 2016, I have described the nature of SMBX2 as the "Biggest
workaround in the Universe". Horikawa Otane agreed with me. She supported
my development of the Engine. However, a while later, the SMBX2 team
majorly changed when Horikawa Otane left the project because of personal reasons. After 2016, I started to procrastinate
and switch to other projects. My biggest mistake was to care a lot
about the SMBX2 development. At the end of 2019,
I finally decided to reduce my attention to SMBX2 and focus on
my own development process.

### SMBX source code was published, founding TheXTech
Through great luck, the source code for the original
SMBX game was finally opened on February 2, 2020. With it comes the huge potential to help
the engine development. One month later, I built a new project called
TheXTech by porting the original source-code into C++, turning the
old Windows-only game into a cross-platform and functional project.

I desired to keep two different engines for two purposes:
- TheXTech for playing old episodes and providing full compatibility
to the original SMBX game including bugs and specifics of it's physics.
- New PGE Engine for new projects focused on modern functionality, without consideration for bugs of the old SMBX Engine.

### Epilogue

**The Project is still Currently Under Construction**, as of now, the Editor
and Development kit is currently available as a standalone application. 
The source code is published on the GitHub repository.

Developing a game engine is a responsibility which requires dedication and hard
work. Sufficient time and motivation is needed for this
goal to be achieved. As of 2021, the development is still
active, I have the goal to build the Engine, and I will go forward!

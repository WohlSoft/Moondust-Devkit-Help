# Editor Overview

![PgeEditor](WhatIsPGEEditor.png ':no-zoom')

**Moondust Editor** - is a flexible and universal editor for levels,
world maps, and NPC configurations. With them, you can build your levels,
world maps, episodes, and even whole games!

The Editor has various tools which will help you to create your levels
and worlds convenient, fast, progressive, and qualitative!

**Editor** - is the part of the Moondust Project development kit. 
Moondust focused on making of 2d side-scrolling platform games.

## How to use Editor

The Editor can sometimes be a tricky UI to navigate. If you know where to look, however, 
you will be able to find what you need fairly quickly. The Editor uses a multi-selection 
model that allows you to quickly manage elements in the scene of Level or World Map. 
You can easily find the rest of the important features on the toolbars and 
in the window menu bar. To manage elements, you will need to use a context menu. 
**[Read more about context menu here](../../Editing/ContextMenu)**.

## Important buttons and options

The following options in the editor are among the most commonly used ones.
You can learn about the functions of the buttons that are not listed by hovering over 
them for a second.

!> Icons look may depend on the current theme. All represented screenshots in this manual
do use the internal icon theme of the Editor. You can change the theme via 
[Application Settings](../../Tools/ApplicationSettings#view).

such extended sections are not currently supported by vanilla SMBX, by SMBX-38A, and by SMBX2.
Adding sections beyond Section 20 is only supported by **Moondust Engine** and 
by **TheXTech** engines.

Changes the editor’s language. Translations may not always be perfectly accurate, 
but if English doesn’t do the job for you, hopefully you will be able to 
find your way around more easily with a different language\!

## Using item sets

Item sets are the main method of adding objects to a level or world map. 
The Editor has two different item sets that can be used for objects adding:

* ![tilesetbox](../../images/icons/tileset_box.png ':no-zoom') **[Tilesets item box](../../Tools/TilesetBox)** - The organized group of item sets that gives an 
organized and sorted look at available elements. You also can make your tilesets of 
the most often used items to organize your work. We suggest using this toolbox by 
newbies who aren't familiar with the available items set. Also, this toolbox will
be useful for users who want to keep their work organized.

![TilesetBox](../../screenshots/Tools/TilesetBox2.png ':size=200px')
![TilesetBox](../../screenshots/Tools/TilesetBox.png ':size=200px')


* ![browserLevel](../../images/icons/item_browser_level.png ':no-zoom')![browserLevel](../../images/icons/item_browser_world.png) 
**[Search Browser / Items Browser](../../EditLevel/ItemBrowser)** - The complete database of available elements 
for placement. It has the filtering by groups and a category, and the flexible 
search of any specific item at the whole database. We suggest using this toolbox 
by experienced users who want the full overlook of all available elements.

## Compare to SMBX 1.3 Editor

Compare to the built-in editor of SMBX 1.3 game.

Unlike the old editor of SMBX, the Moondust Editor uses the multi-selection 
model that gives an ability to work with multiple items at the same time.
Instead of each item dragging to change their properties, you can use a 
context menu. You also can set the same properties to multiple items
at one moment! You can copy, you can paste your stuff into another level/world,
you can undo any accidental changes (and redo them too if needed). Together with
a classic placing mode, you have special tools like a line drawing, rectangular
placement, ellipse, and a flood-fill tool that makes the group item placement
easy and faster. The "Overwrite mode" allows you to replace existing elements on 
a map faster!


### Bugs of SMBX Editor absent in Moondust Editor:</u>

- you have the full freedom with using decimal values in the npc.txt files
(crash won't happen)
- you have the full freedom to use custom sceneries in range 32-65 on the world
map with a correct saving of file (SMBX Editor will crash when you try to save 
a world map having those items).

- you will don't flood with vines or with sceneries when you try
to put them on the map.

- flood-fill is safe: if you did an accidental flood fill of outer space,
the flood-filling process stops after 3 sec. You can undo this and fix your
mistake without Editor reload.

- you will never get the "overflow" message because Moondust Editor has more
space to keep all your items. If you try to save the level or world map into
the legacy format, you will get the warning message that tells you about
exciting limits. It should help you to be sure your file will be compatible
with a legacy game.

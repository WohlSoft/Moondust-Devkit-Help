# SMBX - What is it?

## History

In the year 2009, Andrew "Redigit" Spinks began work on the game: Super Mario Brothers X. 
Gradually the game gathered a following among fans of the Mario game series.

In my opinion, it is perhaps one of the all-time best Mario fan games. It combined 
gameplay elements from games such as Super Mario Bros, by Super Mario Bros. 2, SMB 3, 
Super Mario World, and the Legend of Zelda, etc. The built-in level editor allows 
the user to not only edit levels, along with an engine to debug them in real time, 
but also allows the player to create full-fledged episodes with a plot!

Unfortunately in 2011, Redigit received a call from the lawyers of Nintendo, 
who threatened him and demanded he remove SMBX and stop any further development. 
After some time, the supermariobrothers.org domain was also taken over by Nintendo. 
So such a remarkable project was killed.

But even so, it continued to played. A lot of "episodes" have been made for SMBX, 
and the game is still very popular. However, the game was not perfect. The game would 
often overload the processor to 100%, even when the user is not performing tasks 
or using other programs.

There were several attempts to revive the project, but they all failed.

The main mistake: **the game was published UNDER A COPYRIGHTED BRAND**.

Redigit was making money off SMBX with ads located in the SMBX installer,
on his forums, and on his website. Redigit was making money with
Nintendo's brand and characters, without permission. Nintendo didn't
approve of this and therefore SMBX was shut down.

## SMBX now
As of now, SMBX is still in demand and receives new levels, graphics, and even episodes.
Because of this high demand, LunaDLL has started to be developed in the 2013'th year.
A time later, the LunaLua project was founded by Kevsoft from off the source code for
LunaDLL: the LunaDLL with Lua support. In 2015, Horikawa Otane desired to unify the
chaos of extensions and development tools are existing separately into a united project.
The project was called SMBX 2.0 and was released in December 2015 as Open Beta. It's the
union of various development tools, extensions, and lua scripts.

## Source code
For a long time, the source code was never published. However, since 10 years after 
last release, In February 2, 2020, the original source code of SMBX 1.3 has been 
finally released and published on GitHub with a MIT license. In March 2020, the TheXTech
project has been released by Wohlstand as a modern and cross-platform port of SMBX Engine.

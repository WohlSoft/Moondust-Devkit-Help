!> **Important:** Original SMBX have a bug: do not use decimal values in NPC codes if you want use them with SMBX.
It causes crashing of SMBX for some people. In the Moondust, TheXTech, SMBX2, and SMBX-38A this bug is absence,
and you have full freedom for use decimal values. But if you want to use decimal values for vanilla SMBX,
you must have in the "International standards" settings the dot "." character instead a comma "," character 
as decimal separator.
